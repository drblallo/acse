To install the ACSE compiler type in the console:
 make

To compile some examples (located in the directory ./tests) type:
 make tests


In order to use the compiler/assembler/executor at first you have
to export the directory ./bin in your current PATH as follows:

export PATH=`pwd`/bin:$PATH


You can compile and run new Lance programs in this way (suppose you
have saved a Lance program in 'myprog.src'):

 acse myprog.src myprog.asm
 asm myprog.asm myprog.o
 mace myprog.o
